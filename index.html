    <p>Booah, it's been almost a year la... we had our memorable first fight last Valentine's Day and we have our fight even this Valentine's Day which I am pretty sure we will sort it out like we sorted out most fights.</p>
    <p>I just wanted to thank you for making my life bright and accepting me despite my flaws and defects. It might feel like I am not giving enough importance or not putting enough effort but, I always feel like you give your best. I have no complaints.</p>
    <p>By now you know me completely, in and out. You never hesitated to give love jubi to anyone for that matter and I know that you would put me first always. Sometimes I just wish we both could move out and live somewhere but, we both know that I won't retire.</p>
    <p>I wanna have a kutty family with u. For that, you have to be my wife and for that you have to love me (I hope u do, immeasurably), so with that in mind, I just wanted to ask you that WILL YOU BE MY VALENTINE?..let's watch a movie tomorrow and I love you the most..mostest...mostestestest....ummaaaaaaaaaa</p>
    <p>I thought I could complete this on time but unfortunately, I couldn't and I am soyi...soyi for yelling, cursing, hurting my smol. Now, touch your lips and</p>
